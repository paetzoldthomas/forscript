README for forscript

This project has just been open-sourced, this file is only preliminary.


WHAT IS IT?
===========

Please read <http://scytale.name/proj/forscript/>.


WHAT'S THE STATUS?
==================

It works and does what it's supposed to, although it could log more metadata.
I'm currently working on transforming forscript from a thesis into an ordinary
free software project, for example by providing a readme file and adding an
open-source license (most likely GPLv3) to it.


WHAT ARE ITS REQUIREMENTS?
==========================

To generate the source file or the documentation, you need noweb:
   http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/noweb/
Generating the documentation additionally needs LaTeX and some packages.

To use the (pretty simple) Makefile, you need make. Duh.

To compile the source, a POSIX system with decent C99 compiler and library is
required. Your also need to have the POSIX real-time extensions (clock_gettime)
available. The most popular Unix which doesn't have these is Apple Mac OS X.
Someone could patch forscript to use gettimeofday() there... (hint, hint!)


HOW DO I BUILD IT?
==================

Type "make". This should do the trick on most compatible systems. If your
system is not compatible, hack forscript to support it and send me a patch! :)


HOW CAN I CONTACT YOU?
